        <h3> Constructionism </h3>
        <h5> A different way of learning </h5>
        <p>Seymour Papert, born in South America, had many faces: mathematician, computer scientist, artificial intelligence pioneer, educator and much more. All that turned on his greatest concern: <b>the way children learn in school.</b> According to him, we "build" knowledge. We learn by constructing, exploring and tinkering. It is not about literally constructing out of bricks, blocks, code or paper but rather that our process of learning as humans is an iterative and cumulative one. <br> <br> His biggest inspirator was Jean Piaget, the father of childhood development theory, which led Papert to develop the theory of constructionism. In a nutshell, constructionism advocates student-centered, discovery learning where students use information they already know to acquire more knowledge. Papert's ideas especially became well known through the publication of his books <i>Mindstorms</i> (1980), <i>The Children's Machine</i> (1993) and <i>The Connected Family</i> (1996). His message of learning by actively constructing knowledge through the act of making something sharable is consistent across all three books. <br> <br> His life's work has been creating theories, tools and learning environments that inspire children to construct powerful ideas through firsthand experience, especially using technology.

        <h3 align="right"> Educational Computing </h3>
        <h5 align="right"> Providing tools to think with over a lifetime </h5>
        <p> In the 1960s, when few adults had ever seen a computer, Papert saw them as a way to help children learn by doing. He not only advocated that children should use computers but that they should make things with them through programming. Therefore, he invented the programming language Logo along with Cynthia, Solomon and others. Initially, Logo was developed to teach mathematics in a more applied way. In Mindstorms, Papert stated "The idea of <i>talking mathematics</i> to a computer can be generalized to a view of learning mathematics in <i>Mathland </i>; that is to say, in a context which is to learning mathematics what living in France is to learning French”. <br> <br> In general, Logo have had the aim to make things and learn powerful ideas while making things. Logo uses the concept of turtle graphics. A small triangle on a screen, often replaced by an icon of a turtle,  or a small robot called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(robot)" target="_blank">turtle</a> is directed by simple commands like <i>forward (fd)</i>, <i>backward (bk)</i>, <i>left (lt)</i>, and <i>right (rt)</i>, each command followed by an argument giving distance or turning angle. In combination with the <i>repeat</i> command you could create beautiful drawings with a few commands. <br> <br> Being that simple, the turtle graphics of Logo is a nice way to teach the concept of programming to kids, possibly even pre-school. Logo has helped people to think differently about how to teach geometry and social science through programming. To this day, versions of Logo, including <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>, remain the most popular programming environments for children.

        <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <h5>A groundbreaking co-operation</h5>
        <p>Papert's contributions go beyond the field of education, computing and mathematics. Following several years of work as an mathematician with Jean Piaget, helping him to understand  of how children construct mathematical knowledge in the late 1950s, Papert was invited by Marvin Minsky to join the MIT faculty. Besides tinkering with computers which led him to invent Logo later on, he and Minsky collaborated on pioneering work in the field of artificial intelligence. Together, they founded the <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT</a> and wrote the 1969 book, “Perceptrons: An Introduction to Computational Geometry” which marked a turning point in the field of artificial intelligence. It contains the first systematic study of parallelism in computation and is the first example of a mathematical analysis carried far enough to show the exact limitations of a class of computing machines that could seriously be considered as models of the brain.
